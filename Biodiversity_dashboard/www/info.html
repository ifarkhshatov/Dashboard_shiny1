    <h1>What is Taxonomy?</h1>
    <p>Taxonomy is the science of classification of living organisms. It is used to organize and group organisms based on their characteristics and relationships with each other. Taxonomy helps us understand the diversity of life on earth and the evolutionary relationships between different species.</p>

        <div class="detailed-definition">
          A domain is the highest level of classification in taxonomy. It is a broad category that encompasses all living organisms on earth. There are three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.

        <div class="detailed-definition">
          A kingdom is a category that contains one or more phyla (groups of related organisms). There are six kingdoms in the classification system: Animalia (animals), Plantae (plants), Fungi (fungi), Protista (single-celled organisms), Monera (bacteria), and Archaebacteria (archaea).

        </div>
        <div class="detailed-definition">
          A phylum is a category that contains one or more classes. It is a level of classification that is used to group organisms based on their body structure and other characteristics. For example, the phylum Chordata contains all animals that have a backbone (vertebrates) as well as some that do not (invertebrates).

        <div class="detailed-definition">
          A class is a category that contains one or more orders. It is a level of classification that is used to group organisms based on their characteristics and evolutionary relationships. For example, the class Mammalia contains all mammals, including humans, dogs, cats, and whales.

        <div class="detailed-definition">
          An order is a category that contains one or more families. It is a level of classification that is used to group organisms based on their characteristics and evolutionary relationships. For example, the order Carnivora contains all carnivorous mammals, such as lions, tigers, and bears.

        </div>
        <div class="detailed-definition">
          A family is a category that contains one or more genera (plural of genus). It is a level of classification that is used to group organisms based on their characteristics and evolutionary relationships. For example, the family Felidae contains all cats, including lions, tigers, and house cats.

        <div class="detailed-definition">
          A genus is a category that contains one or more species. It is a level of classification that is used to group organisms based on their characteristics and evolutionary relationships. For example, the genus Canis contains all species of dogs, including wolves, foxes, and domesticated dogs.

        <div class="detailed-definition">
          A species is the lowest level of classification in taxonomy. It is a group of organisms that are similar in appearance, behavior, and genetic makeup. A species is typically defined as a group of organisms that are capable of reproducing with each other and producing offspring that are also capable of reproducing.
